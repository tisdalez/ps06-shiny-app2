For my project, I worked with the SPD Crime data from 2008-2023


The widgets in the first plot change the sample size of the data along with the 
color of the graph, as well as deciding which category of 'crime against'
is going to be in the plot, for example only crimes against people or society.
The widgets in the table change which collumns of data are displayed.
